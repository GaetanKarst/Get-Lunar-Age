### Find out what is your age in the lunar calendar

Did you know that you in some east asian cultures, the age is culturally not calculated the same way as we do in western countries?

This npm library will let you know how old you are in these countries.

```js
const { getLunarAge } = require("./getLunarAge");
console.log(getLunarAge(1995, 12, 31));
```

What you will get: 

```
Your lunar age is 28years old ðŸŒ–
